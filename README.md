## The Best Classifier
In this project, a classifier is built to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. <br>
A historical dataset is loaded from previous loan applications, the data is cleaned,  different classification algorithms are applied on the data. The following algorithms are used to build my models:
- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression<br>


The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoss
