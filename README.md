## The Best Classifier
In this project, I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. <br>
I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms on the data. I used the following algorithms to build my models:
- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression<br>


The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoss
